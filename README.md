- NOTE -> Start with typescript or advanced hooks?
## Readings:

- Advanced hooks
    - [Reducing State](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-reducing-state)
    - [State management with context](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-managing-state-with-the-context-api)
        - [Redux](https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-redux-tutorial-examples/#introduction-redux) (Note only need to read the first 3 sections of this article)
    - [Refs and memoization](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-refs-and-memoization#the-useref-hook)

- Typechecking
  - - [PropTypes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-type-checking-with-proptypes)
  - Typescript
        [What is Typescript](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-typescript/)
        [Typescript for JS programmers](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
  
- Projects:
    - [Project: CV Application](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-cv-application)
    - Bonus: [Project: Memory Card](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card)

## Advanced Hooks

### State Management
   - useReducer
   - useContext
   - Redux
  
### Refs and memoization
 - useRef
 - useMemo
 - useContext

## Custom hooks

## Type checking
- PropTypes
- Typescript



## Refs and Memoization

In addition to advanced hooks, we will also explore the useRef hook and memoization. These topics can greatly optimize your React applications by improving performance and providing more control over DOM elements. Here is a resource that covers these concepts:

- [Refs and memoization](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-refs-and-memoization#the-useref-hook): This resource will introduce you to the useRef hook, which allows you to create a mutable reference that persists across renders. You will also learn about memoization, a technique for optimizing expensive calculations in React components.

## Projects

To apply the concepts you learn in this sprint, you will have the opportunity to work on two projects:

- [Project: CV Application](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-cv-application): In this project, you will build a CV (Curriculum Vitae) application using JavaScript. This will give you hands-on experience in creating a dynamic and interactive application while utilizing the concepts you learn in this sprint.
- 
- Bonus: [Project: Memory Card](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card): If you're up for an additional challenge, you can work on the memory card project. This project involves building a memory card game using React. It will help you reinforce your understanding of React components, state management, and event handling.


By the end of this sprint, you will have a solid understanding of advanced hooks, state management with the Context API and Redux, as well as how to optimize your React applications using useRef and memoization. The projects will allow you to apply your knowledge and further strengthen your skills in real-world scenarios.
