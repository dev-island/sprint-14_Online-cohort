Redux is a popular state management library for React applications. It extends the concepts of the Context API and provides a predictable way to manage application state. Although not required, it is beneficial to have a basic understanding of Redux. The linked article gives an introduction to Redux and covers the fundamental concepts.

## Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps you manage the global state of your application. Redux is often used with React, but it can be used with any other JavaScript framework or library.

The main concept behind Redux is to store the entire state of an application in a central store. The state is then changed by dispatching actions to the store. These actions are processed by reducer functions that generate a new state.
